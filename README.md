# Logistic-Regression-for-Image-Classification-in-Python

This is my very first repository on Github. As a beginner in the field of Machine Learning,I have tried Binary Image Classification using Logistic regression in python. I have used a dataset containing about 250 cat and non-cat images, and classified them accordingly.To represent color images, the red, green and blue channels (RGB) must be specified for each pixel, and so the pixel value is actually a vector of three numbers ranging from 0 to 255.For preprocessing the data, I have divided every row of the dataset by 255. It gives a testing accuracy of 70%.It is actually not bad for this simple model, given the small dataset used and that logistic regression is a linear classifier. 

Refer to the comments section in the project to gain more clarity.
